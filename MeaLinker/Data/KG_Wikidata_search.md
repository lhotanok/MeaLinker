## Knowledge graph search

### Ingredient search

The searching is performed asynchronously once the recipe information page is opened. Each ingredient is tried to be matched with a record in Wikidata and this record is cached.

In case the user hovers to the ingredient name with a mouse cursor, the ingredient cover image is shown and the ingredient name or image can be clicked to get to the page with more detailed info.
