tadduni and her family began a neighborhood italian restaurant in a row home in northeast baltimore. building upon its local popularity, bob and carole reilly purchased the restaurant in 1968 and added several essential features to the angelina's legacy. among these were a renowned irish pub (the first to serve draught guinness in baltimore) and the finishing touches on the celebrated crab cake recipe.\n\nthe success of this signature dish made angelina's name famous far beyond the old neighborhood, and the crab cakes began accumulating a list of awards too lengthy to include here. visitors from across the country came to angelina's seeking the best known crab cakes in a city best known for crab cakes.\" \"this recipe is straightforward and unadulterated and what you will get are authentic maryland-style crab cakes. the real key to making good crab cakes is the use of top quality crab meat, and very little filler as possible. it's equally as important to be very careful

recommends that you cook the rice like a pasta, in abundant salted water (for between 15 and 45 minutes, depending on the rice) and then drain it and dress it when the rice is cool enough to handle.

silk road, but east-west trade extended there, and as a result, korea’s cuisine influenced and was influenced by the travelers on the silk road. pa jun is a korean pancake that can be served as a snack, appetizer, or side dish and is commonly found in korean street markets. it’s a crispy scallion pancake that is chewy and moist on the inside, with fillings of carrots, mung beans and seafood. today you can find it made in many different variations in most korean restaurants, where it is served as a starter with a dipping sauce. though pa jun is typically made with a pancake like batter, my pa jun is gluten free, made with rice flour. it’s speckled with zucchini and carrots and served with a ginger-soy dipping sauce--all together, a sure recipe for no leftovers. these pancakes can be eaten alone without the dipping sauce, just make sure to add some salt to taste to the batter.","ingredients":"['rice flour', 'eggs', 'vegetable oil', 'water', 'scallions', 'carrot', 'zucchini',

these otherwise useless shells into something fantastic! this wonderful stock can be frozen in freezer-type zip-lock bags in one-cup portions (or in ice cube trays) for later use as a clam chowder base, bouillabaisse, seafood casserole liquid or, for any number of recipes which call for seafood stock as a basic ingredient. feel free to use more or less amounts of vegetables found in your refrigerator which may have started to fade in quality. also, you can substitute other vegetables in this stock as you have them available such as cabbage, brussel sprouts, brocolli, bok choy, etc. i hate throwing away produce, don't you? you will want to drink this stock right away when you smell the ambiance of its excellent aroma! it needs no additional salt as the bouillon provides more than

traditionally, it is made with red currants as the star but few people have access to those tart gems unless they grow it, themselves. so now, for ease of preparation, this is made two ways: either with raspberries to add the characteristic tartness of the original version or with a mix of summer berries such as raspberries, blueberries and strawberries. i'm made it every which way: traditional and modern and it's a hit every single time. potato flour is the preferred choice of thickener; it can be purchased in the jewish foods aisle of your store if it's not in the baking aisle. otherwise, ordinary corn starch can be substituted for the potato starch. i serve this in clear glass ramekins to enjoy the jewel-like tones and a thin layer of poured whipping cream is floated over the top. after a heavy meal or when it's scorching hot outside, this is the perfect simple dessert for your friends and family to enjoy. \n\nnote i: a different recipe, using the same ratios, is made with rhubarb.\n\nnote ii: depending upon how you were taught to make this, after the fruit is softened through simmering, some families strain the berries to remove seeds and skins while others don't. it's

weren't quite enough currants for sale at the farmer's market where i buy my produce during the summer. so i bought all they had and thought i'd figure out the rest when i saw how much juice came from my purchase. i came up with 2 cups of currant juice from the 4 pints i bought, then just supplemented with first the pomegranate juice i had on hand, then some cranberry juice, then finally a little bit of water to get to the 6 1/2 cups of juice i needed. you could change the proportions to suit your needs or tastes, using all of one kind of juice or less or more of another juice, you just need 6 1/2 cups total juice for this recipe. prep time includes time to make juice from berries so about 10 hours can be subtracted for this step if you are using juice already made. typically jelly recipes call for you to check for gel 24 hours after processing but mine were a little 'squishy' the next day, then set up great after i forgot about them for a little while, just make sure your seals are good before putting them aside. great on english muffins, but also good as a meat accompaniment or used as a glaze on cornish game hens. the brilliant red colour makes it nice for gift giving,

should look almost uncooked on the top, but slightly golden brown around the edges, 3) the butter and margarine need to be at room temperature but do not microwave in an attempt to speed up the process, 4) the prep time does not include the refrigeration time and 5) be sure to remove the cookies from the pan at the 10 minute mark otherwise they are likely to stick to the pan.

leg and thigh meat, just moist chicken with crispy, seasoned skin. i like to use corn-fed chickens for a truly lovely texture, flavour and colour. the salt crust and seasoning mix that i suggest, really gives a great flavour and crispy finish; however, if you have your own favourite seasoning mix, please use that instead. salting chicken before cooking draws out excess moisture, making the flesh firmer and the skin crispy. serve this roast chicken with traditional accompaniments such as roast potatoes, stuffing, fresh seasonal vegetables and gravy.  (it is nice to buy and cook organic or humanely produced chickens; i realise that they cost a little bit more, but the taste is superior and you will not be supporting a cruel and unnecessary way of animal husbandry - you taste what you pay for!)","ingredients":"['roasting chicken', 'lemon', 'onion', 'fresh herb', 'sea salt', 'butter', 'salt', 'ground black pepper', 'mustard powder', 'sweet

september 2005 - of the new australian magazine 'notebook: ideas for living'.  we have a lot of asian migrants in australia, and as a result a lot of fabulous asian restaurants (representing the
