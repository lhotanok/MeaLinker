When I'm expecting a bigger crowd than usual and have to buy 2 packages of tenderloin, I stick all 4 pieces of meat in one big ziplock and double the marinade recipe.","image":"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92,fl_progressive,w_1200,c_scale/v1/gk-static/fdc-new/img/fdc-shareGraphic.png","recipeCategory":"Pork","keywords":"Meat,Very Low Carbs,< 30 Mins","recipeIngredient":["1 (1 1/2 lb) pork tenderloin","1/2 cup vegetable oil","1/2 cup dry white wine","1/4 cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice","2 cloves garlic, minced","1 teaspoon salt","1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper","1 teaspoon paprika","2 bay leaves"],"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"5.0","reviewCount":"3"},"nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"505","fatContent":"36.5","saturatedFatContent":"6.7","cholesterolContent":"112.3","sodiumContent":"666.9","carbohydrateContent":"3.1","fiberContent":"0.4","sugarContent":"0.7","proteinContent":"35.2"},"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Place meat in a large (1-gallon) heavy-duty resealable plastic bag."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Measure all remaining ingredients into a jar with a tight-fitting lid."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Shake vigorously to combine well; pour marinade over tenderloins."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Note: If marinating in a glass dish instead of a plastic bag, the liquid probably won't cover the tenderloin entirely, so you will need to turn the meat several times for the flavor to penetrate evenly."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"When ready to cook, discard the marinade and grill over medium coals until thoroughly done but still slightly pink in the center (15- 20 minutes)."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Allow meat to rest for about 5 minutes before cutting, spooning a small amount of the juice which collects over each slice."}],"recipeYield":"4-6 serving(s)","review":[{"@type":"Review","description":"This was very tasty, but I have to be honest and say it was not the best I've ever tasted.

Also, I cooked it for 25 minutes instead of 20 because it was still too runny at 20 minutes. It did set up nicely, but even after being refrigerated for at least 3 hours, when I cut into it, the filling stuck terribly to my knife, so I know it needed to have been cooked a little longer.

This was also printed many years ago, but has made a new a recent appearance again paralleling the closure of \"Angelina' and subsequent auction of the restaurant. With the sale of the restaurant this crab cake recipe goes along with it. \r\nHistory as follows from Angelina's website. \"In 1952, Angelina Tadduni and her family began a neighborhood Italian restaurant in a row home in northeast Baltimore. Building upon its local popularity, Bob and Carole Reilly purchased the restaurant in 1968 and added several essential features to the Angelina's legacy. Among these were a renowned Irish pub (the first to serve draught Guinness in Baltimore) and the finishing touches on the celebrated crab cake recipe.\r\n\r\nThe success of this signature dish made Angelina's name famous far beyond the old neighborhood, and the crab cakes began accumulating a list of awards too lengthy to include here. Visitors from across the country came to Angelina's seeking the best known crab cakes in a city best known for crab cakes.\" \"This recipe is straightforward and unadulterated and what you will get are authentic Maryland-style crab cakes. The real key to making good crab cakes is the use of top quality crab meat, and very little filler as possible. It's equally as important to be very careful with the fragile lumps, as you don't want to break up the lumps that provide the best formed crab cakes you will ever see, and without over-mixing. Enjoy this recipe as this is a Baltimore staple, and what a tradition it is.","image":"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92,fl_progressive,w_1200,c_scale/v1/img/recipes/39/30/03/pic3pihDG.jpg","recipeCategory":"Crab","keywords":"High Protein,High In...,Summer,Weeknight,Brunch,< 30 Mins","recipeIngredient":["1 lb lump crabmeat (picked over)","1 cup fresh breadcrumb","1/3 cup milk, approximately (whole or 1/2 & 1/2)","1 egg, beaten slightly","1/4 cup mayonnaise","1/2 teaspoon baking powder","2 teaspoons parsley, fresh chopped","2 teaspoons onions, minced (optional)","1/2 teaspoon salt","1/4 teaspoon white pepper","1 teaspoon flour, sifted for dusting","2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or butter for frying)","cooking spray"],"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"5.0","reviewCount":"8"},"nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"153.1","fatContent":"6.6","saturatedFatContent":"1.2","cholesterolContent":"55.7","sodiumContent":"437.7","carbohydrateContent":"10.3","fiberContent":"0.5","sugarContent":"1.1","proteinContent":"12.5"},"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Put crab meat in a large bowl and cover with bread crumbs and moisten with milk."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Combine beaten egg with the mayonnaise in a separate bowl.

While this recipe certainly uses a lot of pans and gadgets the plan of attack is well laid out for execution. More importantly the taste is soooo good. Light and refreshing with strong fruity flavors. Have to admit at the point I was mixing yogurt with lemon and orange juice, I was a little concerned about curdling but it didn't. Rather the mix was creamy and even more appealing after folding in the egg whites. My Bavarian used non-fat yogurt as I keeps quarts of that in the house. I also used Splenda to replace 1/3 of the sugar called for in the initial mix. Instead of pouring this into a large mold, I purchased a silicone muffin tin in the shape of daisies so the presentation will be individual servings. Made a lovely strawberry-raspberry coulis to go with it and will serve raspberry non-fat yogurt on the side. With my changes, this becomes an impressive 4 WW points for a delightful dessert for our family's Easter dinner.

They turned out well. Obviously they didn't rise like a souffle would have, but the taste was good and my husband really enjoyed. I may serve some of the leftovers to my 8 month old today.

I substituted Egg Beaters for the eggs, replaced the butter with 1 tsp of olive oil (I'd probably just skip it next time), used 3/4 lowfat plain yogurt and 1/4 light mayo for the sauce, and used about 1 T of sriracha instead of the hot pepper sauce to give it more kick. I also upped the garlic powder. Even with all these changes, they were delicious. In terms of serving size, I made 8 patties and served two per serving. They worked out to 7 points, which is spot on for a Weight Watchers lunch. Thank you for a great base recipe - I'm sure they'd be even better made as directed, but I was very pleased that even with modified ingredients, they had such good flavor.

We really enjoyed this recipe, I didn't have enough room for 8 eggs in my 2 1/2 qt dish so I used 7. It is just my DH and I and we ate half of it, I would suggest doubling the recipe if serving to company. I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, a few shakes of seasoning salt, paprika and pepper to the potatoes when in the skillet. It took about 15 minutes for the potatoes to brown up nice. I mixed everything together (except cheese) and put 1/2 potato mix in dish, sprinkled 1/2 small cubed brie cheese over it, topped with the rest of potatoes/cheese and added eggs. I think I made the wells a bit too deep because it took my eggs about 20 min to set. We do like them runny, but next time I'm going to try and scramble them then pour over and bake.

This is the way spaghetti should taste, in my humble opinion. <br/><br/>Okay, first things first, I have two babies under the age of 2 years old, so I refuse to take the precious time to make that lovely-sounding sauce. (It really does sound lovely, but honestly! Too time-consuming! I digress....) I simply bought two 24oz containers of Ragu onion & garlic spaghetti sauce, and use about 1 1/2 jars of it.<br/><br/>Also, I used turkey instead of ground beef. When browning it, I seasoned it in the pan with Lawry's seasoning salt, garlic powder, onion powder, sage, Italian seasoning, & black pepper. Then I add the sauce to it, and voila! It smells so delightful, I must say. Additionally, I use a little more cheese than required, since the family and I are cheese lovers. But overall, even with my little tweaks, this dish is oh-so-tasty!

Still the pie was good.","datePublished":"April 18, 2010","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Thing","name":"Billie Moore’s “mother’s Syrup Coconut Pie"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":4,"bestRating":"5"},"author":"bill mayes"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Food.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/fdc-new/img/FDC-Logo.png"},"url":"https://www.food.com"},"url":"https://www.food.com/recipe/128469","identifier":"85993dd4-e14a-5525-ad76-81c9884ab40b"},"structured":{"foodComId":"128469","time":{"cooking":{"hours":1},"preparation":{"minutes":5},"total":{"hours":1,"minutes":5}},"servings":"8","tags":["Coconut","Fruit","Nuts","< 4 Hours","Easy"],"rating":{"value":4,"reviews":1},"nutritionInfo":{"calories":{"value":669.2,"unit":null},"fat":{"value":30.2,"unit":"g"},"saturatedFat":{"value":11.2,"unit":"g"},"cholesterol":{"value":139.6,"unit":"mg"},"sodium":{"value":482.3,"unit":"mg"},"carbohydrate":{"value":96.8,"unit":"g"},"fiber":{"value":2.5,"unit":"g"},"sugar":{"value":30.4,"unit":"g"},"protein":{"value":7.9,"unit":"g"}},"ingredients":[{"identifier":"658fed79-24e7-5832-917b-a2278987f04b","foodComId":4330,"name":"light corn syrup","amount":"1","text":"cup light corn syrup"},{"identifier":"2a44dc88-4bdf-5812-bdcb-655dc00fca9a","foodComId":2062,"name":"dark corn syrup","amount":"1","text":"cup dark corn syrup"},{"identifier":"98c925ec-4e15-59a9-babe-07352738f99b","foodComId":2683,"name":"flmy","amount":"4","text":"tablespoons flour"},{"identifier":"dec3ff02-b3a8-52ac-8a06-cfa955c3aac3","foodComId":2499,"name":"egg","amount":"6","text":"whole large eggs"},{"identifier":"27e5b623-b874-584b-93f1-e548a6b6adfa","foodComId":4574,"name":"margarine","amount":"1/4","text":"cup melted margarine"},{"identifier":"3ebb9e47-6ebb-5ac4-8f90-22a0b18dceb7","foodComId":7449,"name":"vanilla","amount":"2","text":"teaspoons vanilla"},{"identifier":"e98def41-f90b-5407-9d7a-953dd33a24a5","foodComId":7024,"name":"sweetened flaked coconut","amount":"1 1/2","text":"cups sweetened flaked coconut"},{"identifier":"eb30f736-a99c-5fab-bde5-77484c808240","foodComId":7352,"name":"unbaked pie shell","amount":"2","text":"unbaked 9-inch pie shells"}]}},{"jsonld":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Recipe","mainEntityOfPage":"true","name":"Best-Ever Banana Bread (honestly!)","author":"evelynathens","cookTime":"PT1H","prepTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT1H20M","datePublished":"2003-04-16T20:04Z","description":"This was posted by nlb in epicurious.

After the mixture was cooled, I took an immersion blender and blended it just a bit, so it was a bit smoother but still had chunks, as a personal preference."}],"recipeYield":"6 serving(s)","review":[{"@type":"Review","description":"Great condiment.

I checked the ingredients list and finally after a little trial and error, I came up with this, and it is a pretty close match! Influenced by Malay cuisine, Cape/Malay curry powder/masala is a blend of sweet and pungent spices to include cloves, cardamon, fennel, mustard, coriander, turmeric, fenugreek, a little chilli and black pepper. A curry powder/masala of a mild heat yet full of the flavours you expect in Indian curry. This curry spice mix is wonderful in all types of curries, but especially authentic Cape Malay style cuisine, and of course curries.","image":"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92,fl_progressive,w_1200,c_scale/v1/img/recipes/28/93/83/picYlIFLG.jpg","recipeCategory":"South African","keywords":"Malaysian,Indonesian,African,Asian,Spicy,< 15 Mins,Canning,Easy","recipeIngredient":["1 tablespoon clove","1/2 cup coriander seed","1 tablespoon fennel seed","1 tablespoon black mustard seeds","3 tablespoons fenugreek seeds","2 tablespoons black peppercorns","3 small dried hot red chilies, seeds and stems removed","3 tablespoons cumin seeds","1/4 cup ground cardamom","1/4 cup ground turmeric","1 tablespoon ground ginger","2 curry leaves, chopped into small pieces"],"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"5.0","reviewCount":"10"},"nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"585.7","fatContent":"23.4","saturatedFatContent":"2.9","cholesterolContent":"0","sodiumContent":"106.3","carbohydrateContent":"99.9","fiberContent":"46.8","sugarContent":"3","proteinContent":"25.4"},"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Place all the whole seeds in a frying pan and dry roast for a minute or two, until they become pungent and release their fragrance.

Made this for Bargain Basement Game so I was committed, but when I got to the store there was a sale on pretzels and all that was left was the small pretzel *sticks*. These are difficult to stir and even harder to measure, so it would be better to stick to the twisted variety or nuggets. I used two 1 pound bags of pretzels, added 1 pound of lightly salted roasted peanuts and made 1.5 times the recipe's glaze. Thanks Ridgely, I am sure DH will request this often. NOTE: Be very careful not to touch the glaze when stirring - very hot, and I speak from experience here ;)","datePublished":"January 21, 2007","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Thing","name":"Butter Crunch Pretzels"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":4,"bestRating":"5"},"author":"Kats Mom"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Food.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/fdc-new/img/FDC-Logo.png"},"url":"https://www.food.com"},"url":"https://www.food.com/recipe/48756","identifier":"05b55a19-145f-5336-9037-2b4627c83fd2"},"structured":{"foodComId":"48756","time":{"cooking":{"hours":1},"preparation":{"minutes":20},"total":{"hours":1,"minutes":20}},"servings":"20","tags":["Weeknight","< 4 Hours"],"rating":{"value":4,"reviews":1},"nutritionInfo":{"calories":{"value":783.7,"unit":null},"fat":{"value":9.4,"unit":"g"},"saturatedFat":{"value":3.8,"unit":"g"},"cholesterol":{"value":12.2,"unit":"mg"},"sodium":{"value":2533.2,"unit":"mg"},"carbohydrate":{"value":158.7,"unit":"g"},"fiber":{"value":5.4,"unit":"g"},"sugar":{"value":16.7,"unit":"g"},"protein":{"value":18.8,"unit":"g"}},"ingredients":[{"identifier":"76c689e2-a132-5d65-958c-c9e74529572c","foodComId":5711,"name":"pretzel","amount":"16","text":"cups small twisted pretzels"},{"identifier":"9986ebc6-2b7b-5f2a-9b16-97853f76bd25","foodComId":800,"name":"brown sugar","amount":"1","text":"cup firmly packed brown sugar"},{"identifier":"9bec9369-9c58-57e8-b55b-ccd48abb2eda","foodComId":840,"name":"butter","amount":"1/2","text":"cup butter or 1/2 cup margarine"},{"identifier":"658fed79-24e7-5832-917b-a2278987f04b","foodComId":4330,"name":"light corn syrup","amount":"1/4","text":"cup light corn syrup"},{"identifier":"8639d5d6-cae0-5357-a595-5082d3a6fe7f","foodComId":7455,"name":"vanilla butternuting","amount":"1","text":"teaspoon vanilla butternut flavoring"},{"identifier":"9d3235f2-1c5c-5f8d-ad08-70f0bee5164a","foodComId":335,"name":"baking soda","amount":"1/2","text":"teaspoon baking soda"}]}},{"jsonld":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Recipe","mainEntityOfPage":"true","name":"Butternut Squash and Barley Risotto","author":"C and Ds Mommy","cookTime":"PT50M","prepTime":"PT10M","totalTime":"PT1H","datePublished":"2007-01-09T16:41Z","description":"Typically, risottos are made of refined rice known as Aborio.

When I found this recipe in an issue of Cook's Country Magazine (part of the Cook's Illustrated family) I knew I had to make this. Forget BBQ sauce... this is an amazing recipe! Cook's Illustrated adapted this recipe where you used wood chips, soaked in water. You grill the tri-tip, seasoned only with salt &amp; pepper (the Santa Maria way) and-- towards the end-- you add the wet chips to the coals to give a smoky flavor to the meat.

Leave the fat cap on until after cooking as it helps seal in the juices (and flavor!). Be sure to let the meat rest 10-20 minutes before cutting into it, or the juices will run out. Great served with fresh salsa (see my recipe #117811) and cowboy beans.

However, it simmered on. Upon serving it, it went from \"ok\" to \"absolutely outstanding\" in about four spoonfulls. (My point being: if the first spoonful doesn't appeal to you, keep eating it at least for a little while). Very delicious, even tho I forgot to put in the yogurt! I have leftovers and will add that to it tomorrow. I used nonfat milk; can't get a boil on that until you put in the full-fat Stilton. So just heated it up well, then put in the Stilton, brought to boil and simmered. It's probably why it looks a little curdled but I don't care as I just cannot justify the fat and cholesterol in anything else besides nonfat milk. The cheese has enough of those both. This would be great served with unsalted, unbuttered popcorn on top as a garnish. Didn't have any, so I just added some saltines. Whatever you do, do not leave out anything else. The celery and walnuts were absolutely essential. When I reheated the leftovers today (one day later), I added in the yogurt. I think I may like it better w/o it, but at the very least, I think it is an optional ingredient.

We can't use the stove, so I hooked up an electric skillet in another part of the house. I didn't have fresh chives or green onions and didn't use the booze. I only had dried parsley. I added fresh mushrooms to the broth before pouring it over the chicken. It tastes awesome! The chicken was tender and so were the mushrooms and the sauce is really delightful!

The butter burns very quickly so I used instead a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of butter and oil - keeps the buttery flavor but doesn't burn. As for 'hammering' out the chicken, I found placing it into a ziplock bag did the trick - it stayed put while being pressed out. The wine seemed to reduce to quickly, covering and cooking at a lower temperature could solve that problem. My DH asked if I was trying to 'hide' the sausage! The flavor didn't come through as I had expected it would, though still tasty enough. Using a spicier sausage (I used mild Italian) could make the difference. Preferring my mushrooms lightly sauteed, I added them with the onions and did need to add a little more butter to the pan as they quickly absorb any liquids. I found the quantity of the vegetables to much for the amount of sauce so I cut back on them and still had to add more puree. Since my DH can't eat rice presently, I opted for pasta and it paired well with this dish, both in taste and in appearance. We enjoyed the end result ok but with the time and effort involved, I doubt I'll be making this one again.

I put the cake back in and raised the temperature to 350 degrees F. I baked at that temp for 40 more minutes and then it turned out wonderfully! Like a gooey brownie with fluffiness like a cake. Really, the chocolate chips melt even at the 325 temp so they didn't act as a different texture or treat within the cake. Definitely a death by chocolate experience and maybe next time I would use a larger pan instead of the 10\" round pan and then this baking time might be correct.

I did not use nuts either time (I just don't like them in desserts).<br/>Also, it would be really helpful if there was a temperature listed for baking (I did 350* F) and if it included a recommended baking dish size (I used an 8x8).<br/>It looks fine, and tastes okay, but something is just a bit off (I can't quite put my finger on it).

There were still blooms on the plants in November when we got our first frost. But Andy was on top of things and ran outside and plucked off all the remaining tomatoes so they wouldn't be ruined. We ended up with what seemed like an overwhelming amount of tomatoes, mostly green but some good red ones too.\r\n \r\nWe decided to make Chow Chow with them. For those who don't know, it is a green tomato relish made with the final harvest vegetables, and is very popular here in Tennessee. It is most commonly used to season pinto beans or white beans, which are also very popular in the South. They are cooked with ham and everyone down here just loves them. Take a big spoonful of chow chow and put it on top of your bowl full of beans before you eat them. Since I tried my first chow chow, I can't eat beans without it.\r\n \r\nWe had no idea how to make it so we pulled about a dozen recipes off the internet and just used them as a guide, incorporating our favorite aspects of each recipe into our own Chow Chow. Neither one of us had ever canned on our own before, so it was a really big deal to us! We are quite proud of our finished product. We ended up with a lot of it and gave it out as Christmas gifts to a lot of our friends.","image":"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92,fl_progressive,w_1200,c_scale/v1/gk-static/fdc-new/img/fdc-shareGraphic.png","recipeCategory":"Chutneys","keywords":"Sauces,Onions,Peppers,Vegetable,Low Protein,Vegan,Low Cholesterol,Healthy,Kosher,Spicy,Canning,Inexpensive","recipeIngredient":["2 gallons finely chopped green tomatoes (I threw in some red ones, too)","7 bell peppers (3 green, 2 red, 2 yellow)","1 head cabbage","1 head cauliflower","1 bunch celery (use the whole thing, including heart with leaves, just trim off a little of the root end)","6 large yellow onions (maybe 8 or 9 medium ones?)","2 1/2 quarts cider vinegar","2 cups white sugar","1 cup brown sugar","8 fresh hot peppers (serrano, cayenne, jalapeno or Tabasco)","1 1/4 cups canning & pickling salt","1 (4 ounce) jar prepared horseradish","8 large heads of garlic, separated & peeled","4 tablespoons turmeric","3 tablespoons ground mustard","3 tablespoons ground allspice","3 tablespoons ground cloves","4 teaspoons ground ginger"],"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"5.0","reviewCount":"1"},"nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"610.5","fatContent":"3.7","saturatedFatContent":"0.6","cholesterolContent":"0","sodiumContent":"14368.3","carbohydrateContent":"133.7","fiberContent":"16.9","sugarContent":"99.5","proteinContent":"14.9"},"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add 1 cup of the salt to the chopped tomatoes in a very large plastic or glass bowl (must be non-reactive, not metal).

And the spices, I thought some were overdone, mainly the turmeric, allspice and cloves. If I did it again I'd choose to still add them but reduce their amounts to 1/2. Conversely, I think there could be more ginger &amp; ground mustard -- maybe double them? (Read next year's critique.) And lastly, I think we should have added ground black pepper.

He says rice salads are among the few salads that don't deteriorate after the dressing is added, so they can be dressed minutes or hours ahead. He recommends that you cook the rice a bit in advance, and dress it before it gets too cold.

I'll make this again when I actually have Greek yogurt on hand.","datePublished":"July 30, 2007","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Thing","name":"Coffee Frozen Yogurt"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":4,"bestRating":"5"},"author":"The Pixelated Veget"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Food.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/fdc-new/img/FDC-Logo.png"},"url":"https://www.food.com"},"url":"https://www.food.com/recipe/229877","identifier":"ef117d3f-8ab7-5498-9ad5-022f5d4cc6a5"},"structured":{"foodComId":"229877","time":{"cooking":{"hours":6},"preparation":{"minutes":30},"total":{"hours":6,"minutes":30}},"servings":"8","tags":["Dessert","Low Protein","Healthy","Easy"],"rating":{"value":4,"reviews":1},"nutritionInfo":{"calories":{"value":245.8,"unit":null},"fat":{"value":5,"unit":"g"},"saturatedFat":{"value":2.7,"unit":"g"},"cholesterol":{"value":67.4,"unit":"mg"},"sodium":{"value":141.9,"unit":"mg"},"carbohydrate":{"value":44.1,"unit":"g"},"fiber":{"value":0,"unit":"g"},"sugar":{"value":41.1,"unit":"g"},"protein":{"value":5.2,"unit":"g"}},"ingredients":[{"identifier":"7eab4ac5-3b1f-55d4-b68d-791d0d04ae20","foodComId":4717,"name":"milk","amount":"2","text":"cups milk"},{"identifier":"3439b15d-cdce-513f-a8bb-5d512abc0edd","foodComId":6906,"name":"sugar","amount":"1 1/2","text":"cups sugar"},{"identifier":"dec3ff02-b3a8-52ac-8a06-cfa955c3aac3","foodComId":2499,"name":"egg","amount":"2","text":"eggs, beaten"},{"identifier":"7afe80ee-60b0-5adc-846a-777bf5896ed4","foodComId":1625,"name":"coffee","amount":"1","text":"cup coffee (cold, very strong)"},{"identifier":"363d826e-d864-5242-b5a2-515ea5a661fe","foodComId":6270,"name":"salt","amount":"1/4","text":"teaspoon salt"},{"identifier":"8495ff1d-4bc5-5c65-9c8a-437b93d69b9e","foodComId":7998,"name":"yogurt","amount":"1 1/2","text":"cups yogurt (plain, you can use nonfat if you use Greek strained yogurt)"},{"identifier":"3ebb9e47-6ebb-5ac4-8f90-22a0b18dceb7","foodComId":7449,"name":"vanilla","amount":"1","text":"teaspoon vanilla"},{"identifier":"babc2cd6-53d3-5b7e-888c-2a1dec299b28","foodComId":4018,"name":"kahlua","amount":"2","text":"tablespoons Kahlua (or other coffee-flavored liqueur)"}]}},{"jsonld":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Recipe","mainEntityOfPage":"true","name":"Coca-Cola Cake (Closest to Cracker Barrel's)","author":"BlueMoon76","cookTime":"PT40M","prepTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT1H","datePublished":"2008-10-05T02:41Z","description":"I modified and combined a few recipes I found to get to this recipe.

It was good for time 1 and 2 but outstanding for this 3rd time. <br/><br/>I used House Autry Medium white cornmeal, omitted the Splenda and used regular sour cream-not fat free. Each time, I melted bacon grease in my small iron skillet prior to pouring in the batter.

I am pleased to be the first one to write a review on this recipe! First of all, I chose it because it feeds more than one, and all the ingredients were at my local store and it was easier than making my own dough. We are vacationing at my Moms little house which only has a tiny mini kitchen with a very small oven, so a 10\" x 12\" pan just happened to be the largest she had. I had to roll out the dough and cut about 4\" off that wouldnt fit into the pan, and next time in our oven, I will use a 11\" x 14\" cookie sheet and just make it bigger! I used way less cheese, (less than one 8oz package), bought Ragu Pizza sauce (and reserved the unused portion for dipping) and made the filling Pineapple, Onion, Green Onion, and Olive. Wow again, just writeing about it the next morning makes me want to heat up the leftovers for breakfast! :) It came out lovely, and the super picky vegetarian boyfriend almost got third helpings! 375 and 25 mins for us.

When prompted for his opinion, DBF said \"It's good, but it could use some oregano.\" So he sprinkled his pieces with oregano and happily munched away. In addition to the vegetables, I sprinkled low-fat feta over top. Next time, I will probably leave out the olives (at least from my half of the bread) because, try as I might, I just can't come to like the buggers. Also, instead of using fresh tomatoes over top, I might just chop up some sun-dried tomatoes and add them to the peppers and eggplant. Or I might do both kinds of tomatoes. :-) The dough was quite a bit of work for me, as I am not a big bread/dough maker, so this will likely only be for special occassions. Or I will just do the vegetables and layer it on a pre-made crust.

The smell and taste of this bread really brought back wonderful memories. My mother's family is Finnish and our grandmother would always bring us Nissua, or Nisu, especially for Christmas! (the family came from Finland in the late 1800's and settled in a small town in northeastern Ohio called Ashtabula). We've lost a number of our elders over the past several years, including my mom and her mother. Making this for the family was so very special for us; my dad was only going to eat one piece but he was back for seconds, and thirds, all within 10 minutes of the first cut! I think he missed this tasty treat as much as we did. This is real yummy when toasted and spread with fresh butter. My sister-in-law couldn't get enough of it and had a slice every morning for breakfast during their visit. This will definitely become a Christmas family tradition from now on!","datePublished":"December 11, 2010","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Thing","name":"Finnish Nisu - Sweet Bread"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":5,"bestRating":"5"},"author":"KyAmy"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Food.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/fdc-new/img/FDC-Logo.png"},"url":"https://www.food.com"},"url":"https://www.food.com/recipe/68014","identifier":"a1e3ee05-ea25-55d1-ab10-73e5bf39ca21"},"structured":{"foodComId":"68014","time":{"cooking":{"minutes":30},"preparation":{"hours":2,"minutes":30},"total":{"hours":3}},"servings":"3","tags":["Finnish","Scandinavian","European","Healthy","Weeknight","< 4 Hours"],"rating":{"value":5,"reviews":2},"nutritionInfo":{"calories":{"value":1892.1,"unit":null},"fat":{"value":50.1,"unit":"g"},"saturatedFat":{"value":27.7,"unit":"g"},"cholesterol":{"value":399,"unit":"mg"},"sodium":{"value":2002.1,"unit":"mg"},"carbohydrate":{"value":302.8,"unit":"g"},"fiber":{"value":10.2,"unit":"g"},"sugar":{"value":34.7,"unit":"g"},"protein":{"value":53.4,"unit":"g"}},"ingredients":[{"amount":"2","text":"packages active dry yeast"},{"amount":"3/4","text":"cup warm water"},{"amount":"1","text":"(13 ounce) can undiluted evaporated milk, heated to 110 degrees"},{"amount":"1/2","text":"-1 cup sugar"},{"amount":"2","text":"teaspoons salt"},{"amount":"1","text":"teaspoon crushed cardamom, seed"},{"amount":"4","text":"eggs, beaten"},{"amount":"1/2","text":"cup softened butter"},{"amount":"8-9","text":"cups all-purpose flour"},{"amount":null,"text":"egg, mixed with"},{"amount":null,"text":"milk, for glaze"},{"amount":null,"text":"sliced almonds or plain sugar, for decoration"}]}},{"jsonld":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Recipe","mainEntityOfPage":"true","name":"Fitness Muffins","author":"Lalaloula","cookTime":"PT20M","prepTime":"PT15M","totalTime":"PT35M","datePublished":"2009-06-22T11:03Z","description":"Make and share this Fitness Muffins recipe from Food.com.","image":"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92,fl_progressive,w_1200,c_scale/v1/img/recipes/37/81/07/pic5QFFMU.jpg","recipeCategory":"Quick Breads","keywords":"Breads,Lunch/Snacks,Vegetable,Egg Free,Free Of...,Potluck,Brunch,< 60 Mins,Easy","recipeIngredient":["60 g bell peppers, chopped","1 tomatoes, diced","100 g sweet corn (I use canned)","100 g peas (fresh and prepared or frozen and thawed)","100 g flour","100 g whole grain flour (I use spelt)","2 teaspoons baking powder","80 ml olive oil","100 ml buttermilk","salt and pepper","6 tablespoons parmesan cheese, grated"],"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"5.0","reviewCount":"3"},"nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"214.8","fatContent":"10.3","saturatedFatContent":"2","cholesterolContent":"3.8","sodiumContent":"165.4","carbohydrateContent":"25.4","fiberContent":"2","sugarContent":"2.4","proteinContent":"5.7"},"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C/400&deg;F."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Combine flours and baking powder.

I found \"mix dal\" at my local asian store, and happlily, it had all of the required lentils, so I used 1 1/4 cups of this mix. I took magpie's advice, and doubled the tumeric and cayenne in the lentil mix, because when I tasted it after soaking and halfway through cooking, I couldn't really make out the spices very well. I also found that when the lentils were finished cooking, they were pretty soupy (and I know this is stew), but (don't laugh), I strained out some of the water, and was really pleased with the end result! In fact, when making again, I would start with 4 cups of water because I think I removed about a cup.

I&#039;m glad I finally made it, because it&#039;s delicious. It&#039;s rare to find tarragon in fried chicken recipes. What I like about this recipe is there&#039;s just the right amount of salt and pepper in the breading -- many recipes don&#039;t have enough of either. I tried this again using it to bread cod fish filets -- and it&#039;s excellent (you should try it!).

The older two said they were pretty good, but not quite the same as they've had at amusement parks. I'm sure it's because I didn't do something right. They were very crispy on the edges, and the got quite dark on the bottom before the top was cooked, so I flipped them over, and I'm certain that is not supposed to be required.

For my own tastes I would leave out the lemon.","datePublished":"March 20, 2008","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Thing","name":"Glazed Carrots - Weight Watchers"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":3,"bestRating":"5"},"author":"justcallmetoni"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Food.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/fdc-new/img/FDC-Logo.png"},"url":"https://www.food.com"},"url":"https://www.food.com/recipe/262739","identifier":"5a1aba4c-94aa-5c98-ad89-418888d5edff"},"structured":{"foodComId":"262739","time":{"cooking":{"minutes":10},"preparation":{"minutes":20},"total":{"minutes":30}},"servings":"2","tags":["Low Protein","Low Cholesterol","Healthy","< 30 Mins","Easy"],"rating":{"value":3,"reviews":1},"nutritionInfo":{"calories":{"value":112.4,"unit":null},"fat":{"value":4,"unit":"g"},"saturatedFat":{"value":0.7,"unit":"g"},"cholesterol":{"value":0,"unit":"mg"},"sodium":{"value":322.9,"unit":"mg"},"carbohydrate":{"value":19.6,"unit":"g"},"fiber":{"value":3.7,"unit":"g"},"sugar":{"value":12,"unit":"g"},"protein":{"value":1.4,"unit":"g"}},"ingredients":[{"identifier":"27e5b623-b874-584b-93f1-e548a6b6adfa","foodComId":4574,"name":"margarine","amount":"4","text":"teaspoons reduced-calorie margarine"},{"identifier":"fc66fa61-a9d2-581c-9240-4c1ab81f5a9e","foodComId":5966,"name":"red onion","amount":"1/4","text":"red onion"},{"identifier":"ad609026-7f62-5472-a64f-2dcf0fac7f00","foodComId":2832,"name":"fresh lemon juice","amount":"1","text":"tablespoon fresh lemon juice"},{"identifier":"ea21fdfe-2f57-5090-9884-a769570eb7f5","foodComId":3723,"name":"honey","amount":"2","text":"teaspoons honey"},{"identifier":"4809a8a8-6409-5dd2-a461-5fdfef86fe3a","foodComId":1511,"name":"cinnamon","amount":"1/8","text":"teaspoon cinnamon"},{"identifier":"363d826e-d864-5242-b5a2-515ea5a661fe","foodComId":6270,"name":"salt","amount":"1/8","text":"teaspoon salt"},{"identifier":"c4691ef0-cf18-5a2c-bf7c-fb594342d724","foodComId":1093,"name":"carrot","amount":"4","text":"carrots, sliced and steamed"}]}},{"jsonld":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Recipe","mainEntityOfPage":"true","name":"Gluten-Free Carrot Cake with Orange Frosting","author":"Chrissyo","cookTime":"PT1H","prepTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT1H20M","datePublished":"2002-05-07T19:22Z","description":"Make and share this Gluten-Free Carrot Cake with Orange Frosting recipe from Food.com.","image":"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92,fl_progressive,w_1200,c_scale/v1/gk-static/fdc-new/img/fdc-shareGraphic.png","recipeCategory":"Dessert","keywords":"Vegetable,Australian,Free Of...,Weeknight,< 4 Hours,Easy","recipeIngredient":["1 cup soya flour or 1 cup besan flour","3/4 cup maize cornflour (100% corn)","2 teaspoons gluten free baking powder","1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda","2 teaspoons mixed spice","1 cup firmly packed brown sugar","1 1/2 cups grated carrots (about two medium carrots)","1 cup chopped walnuts","1/2 cup light olive oil","1/2 cup sour cream","3 eggs, lightly beaten","125 g cream cheese, chopped","1 teaspoon finely grated orange rind","1 1/2 cups icing sugar"],"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"5.0","reviewCount":"8"},"nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"610.6","fatContent":"35.7","saturatedFatContent":"8.4","cholesterolContent":"94.4","sodiumContent":"272.9","carbohydrateContent":"67.1","fiberContent":"3.5","sugarContent":"52.1","proteinContent":"10.4"},"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"CARROT CAKE: Preheat the oven to moderately slow (160c)."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Grease a deep 20cm round cake tin, line the base and sides with baking paper."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Sift flours, baking powder, bicarbonate soda and spice into a large bowl."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Stir in the sugar, carrot and walnuts."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Stir in the combined oil, cream and eggs until smooth."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Pour the mixture into prepared cake tin and bake in a moderately slow oven for about one hour."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Stand the cake for 10 minutes before turning onto a wire cake rack to cool."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Top cake with Orange Frosting."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"ORANGE FROSTING: Beat the cheese and the rind in a small bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Gradually beat in the sifted icing sugar until smooth."}],"recipeYield":"8 serving(s)","review":[{"@type":"Review","description":"I used white bean flour for besan and white rice for the cornflour.

The chicken turned out moist and tender. I halved the amounts, using two thighs, and fresh dill and basil. I did substitute red onion for the shallots, which I often do, because shallots are hard to find where I live. Other than that, I followed the recipe for ingredients and proportions. I'm having a hard time deciding whether to give 4 or 5 stars. It made a good meal for me, but the dill basil combination is not one that I am used to, and am not sure that I would like to make again. Frankly, I think I would be happier if the recipe used either dill or basil, rather than mixing them. One more proof that we are all different, I guess. Thank you for giving me this chance to refine my tastes.","datePublished":"May 11, 2012","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Thing","name":"Garlic Dill Chicken"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":4,"bestRating":"5"},"author":"mianbao"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Food.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/fdc-new/img/FDC-Logo.png"},"url":"https://www.food.com"},"url":"https://www.food.com/recipe/87106","identifier":"dd8c7d82-7599-511b-83cc-c06b0111c52d"},"structured":{"foodComId":"87106","time":{"cooking":{"hours":1},"preparation":{"hours":1,"minutes":30},"total":{"hours":2,"minutes":30}},"servings":"4","tags":["Poultry","Meat","Canadian","Oven","< 4 Hours"],"rating":{"value":2.5,"reviews":2},"nutritionInfo":{"calories":{"value":666.1,"unit":null},"fat":{"value":49.4,"unit":"g"},"saturatedFat":{"value":11.8,"unit":"g"},"cholesterol":{"value":192.8,"unit":"mg"},"sodium":{"value":263.4,"unit":"mg"},"carbohydrate":{"value":12,"unit":"g"},"fiber":{"value":1.3,"unit":"g"},"sugar":{"value":1.4,"unit":"g"},"protein":{"value":42.5,"unit":"g"}},"ingredients":[{"identifier":"6f3db658-0d52-5627-b02e-b24b6358c435","foodComId":3184,"name":"garlic","amount":"4","text":"cloves garlic, finely chopped"},{"identifier":"0d73c452-bcf3-5056-9f04-71f80ad7f8be","foodComId":6426,"name":"shallot","amount":"4","text":"large shallots, finely chopped"},{"identifier":"a250efed-b788-5e7a-8171-71c37afa2c93","foodComId":2794,"name":"fresh dill","amount":"4","text":"tablespoons chopped fresh dill or 1 tablespoon dried dill"},{"identifier":"c9279aaf-5d51-5e4c-b2a8-278c9e468a29","foodComId":2757,"name":"fresh basil","amount":"1","text":"tablespoon chopped fresh basil or 1 teaspoon dried basil"},{"identifier":"6d9567e8-684c-57c6-a43a-59023d529002","foodComId":5168,"name":"paprika","amount":"1","text":"tablespoon paprika"},{"identifier":"69a0e3d2-7984-53cd-bea9-8dc906156ed2","foodComId":5006,"name":"olive oil","amount":"2","text":"tablespoons olive oil"},{"identifier":"1e3e1cc2-23a0-5ee9-9275-db4404ba2c43","foodComId":7557,"name":"vegetable oil","amount":"2","text":"tablespoons vegetable oil"},{"identifier":"008c8715-0268-5939-aa7c-296f3f2e2ddb","foodComId":4253,"name":"lemon juice","amount":"2","text":"tablespoons lemon juice"},{"identifier":"ad3ed7dd-3232-5524-931b-9285933ee860","foodComId":1306,"name":"chicken thigh","amount":"2","text":"lbs chicken thighs"},{"identifier":"243c90cb-d47e-592d-882a-ab677764b806","foodComId":7887,"name":"whole wheat flmy","amount":"3","text":"tablespoons whole wheat flour"},{"identifier":"53cae76b-e1c0-5dde-ad38-e5ec0c00cf27","foodComId":1297,"name":"chicken stock","amount":"1","text":"cup chicken stock"}]}},{"jsonld":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Recipe","mainEntityOfPage":"true","name":"Glazes for Fruit Pies, Tarts, and Coffee Cakes (Apricot, Peach,","author":"AmyZoe","cookTime":"PT15M","prepTime":"PT10M","totalTime":"PT25M","datePublished":"2009-12-20T10:04Z","description":"Ever need to make a glaze for a pie?

I had to use sour cream and regular mayo. For my own tastes, I added about a tsp. of vinegar because I like that zing in dressings, and I added a bit of finely chopped green onion. I also threw in some sliced ripe olives instead of putting it on the steak. And I sauteed the steak in a pan with some sliced onion. \r\n\r\nThat being said, whatever you do, I doubt there is anything that can make this sauce less than great. The only change I made that I would recommend keeping is the green onion. And don't leave out the cucumber or tomato. I think the vegetables together are what gives it that wonderful greek street vendor sauce taste I haven't had since leaving New York over 10 years ago. I had forgotten how much I missed it, and the first bite brought it all back. \r\n\r\nBrenda, thank you for posting it! It brought back so many memories, and on a night I thought I was going to have yucky leftovers, I ended up having one of the best meals in a long time.
