PP_recipes.csv and RAW_recipes.csv were downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions).

Their size exceeds GitHub limit of 100 MB so they're only stored locally
and should be downloaded manually to the cloned repository.

RAW_recipes.json is a testing subset of the original RAW_recipes.csv converted into json format.
It can be easily replaced with a json file containing more recipes from RAW_recipes.csv to build
richer recipes database.
